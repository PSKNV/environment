Before you assemble yourself, there are a few things you should know:

1. If you use GUI Emacs, run `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts` so you
   don't get weird symbols all over the place.

2. Whenever you edit dna.el or modify modules, run:

     bin/nucleus refresh

   This will ensure all needed packages are installed, all orphaned
   packages are removed, and your autoloads files are up to date. This
   is important! If you forget to do this you will get errors!

3. If something inexplicably goes wrong, it's a good idea to try:

     bin/nucleus doctor

   This will diagnose common issues with your environment and setup,
   and may give you clues about what is wrong.

4. To update nucleus, run

     bin/nucleus upgrade

   Doing it any other way will require you run `bin/nucleus refresh`
   otherwise,

5. Check out `bin/nucleus help` to see what else it can do (it is
   recommended you add ~/.emacs.d/bin to your PATH).

Have fun!
