Personal Emacs configurations. Tremendously boosted by [[http://spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]].

* Install Emacs

For OS X users I recommend to install [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][emacs-plus]] - GNU Emacs with some sane
defaults, available via [[https://brew.sh][brew]] package manager.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
$ brew install emacs-plus
#+END_SRC

But you are freeâ„¢ to use whatever Emacs variant you wish to use, though I don't
give any guarantees that it will work with these configurations. In case you
wish to investigate more on this topic, please refer to [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/274/5161][this answer]].

* Run-time dependencies

Emacs domain has lots of run-time dependencies. It's better to install them
using global Eru.

* Configuration basis

Right now my configrations have 3 basis:

- Spacemacs
- Doom
- Nucleus

You can choose to use any of them by either modifying =emacs-basis= variable in
=init.el= file or by setting =EMACS_BASIS= environment variable:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
EMACS_BASIS=nucleus; emacs -nw
#+END_SRC

* Nucleus

Nucleus is a very opinionated fork of [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom-emacs]] core with some ideas stolen
from [[http://spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]]. Nucleus was created in the attempt to find a holy grail.

It's in early stages of development so I advice you to be careful.
