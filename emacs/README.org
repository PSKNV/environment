* Install Emacs

For OS X users I recommend to install [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][emacs-plus]] - GNU Emacs with some sane
defaults, available via [[https://brew.sh][brew]] package manager.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
$ brew install emacs-plus
#+END_SRC

But you are freeâ„¢ to use whatever Emacs variant you wish to use, though I don't
give any guarantees that it will work with these configurations. In case you
wish to investigate more on this topic, please refer to [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/274/5161][this answer]].

/Section is under construction. Please return in -2147483648 seconds./

* Run-time dependencies

Emacs domain has lots of run-time dependencies. It's better to install them
using global install script.

* Key bindings

Most of the key bindings are set by [[http://spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]] and enabled layers. Please refer
to [[file:spacemacs/spacemacs.el][spacemacs.el]] file for more hints.
