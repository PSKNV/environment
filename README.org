This repository contains configurations to various tools that I am trying to
keep clean and organized.

* What's inside?
All configurations that I fear to loose by making =rm -rf ~/= (accidentally, for
sure). Configurations are divided into domains like =emacs=, =git=, =haskell=,
=fish= etc. Every domain has it's own readme file, so make sure to check them as
well before running installation script. There is also =deprecated= domain.
There are things that are no more used but has little value for me. Time to time
I clean that domain, so don't be surprised to see it's missing.

* Dependencies
My configurations are expecting that a lot of stuff is installed on your system.
As it was already told, every domain has it's own readme file where the full
list of dependencies is written down.

But be aware that I am using OS X and haven't tested my configurations beyond
this operating system. They should work, but I can't promise :smile:.

The installation script will try to get some of the dependencies if you are
using OS X. Dependencies are installed via =bootstrap= script, which can be
found in the root of =environment= and in some of domains. For example, root
=bootstrap= script will install =brew= if you don't have one.

* Usage
The most important thing - you need to clone this repo into =~/.config=.
Otherwise fish and emacs will not work properly. Then call

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ ./bootstrap/eru.sh [theme] [theme] ...
#+END_SRC

If you are on a new laptop,

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d12frosted/environment/master/bootstrap/eru.sh | bash
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_HTML
<p align="center">
  <img src="bootstrap/images/eru-example-1.png">
</p>
#+END_HTML

* Can I use your files?
Sure you can. But should you? :D

OK, jokes aside. It would be a pleasure to me knowing that someone finds
something useful in my configurations. I am trying to keep things as clear as
possible, but these are *personal* configurations, so I rarely think about any
compatibility with previous configurations or other platforms. In any case, if
you have questions or any problems with my configurations - just ping me. I'll
try to help you as much as I can. Any suggestions or pull requests are warmly
welcome!
