This repository contains configurations to various tools that I am trying to
keep clean and organized.

* What's inside?
All configurations that I fear to loose by making =rm -rf ~/= (accidentally, for
sure). Configurations are divided into domains like =emacs=, =git=, =haskell=,
=fish= etc.

All of the configurations as well as dependencies are maintained using Eru - a
script that creates the universe.

* Eru domain

As you might know, Eru is the supreme deity of Arda. The first things that Eru
created where the Ainur. He then bade the Ainur to sing to him. Each Ainu had a
particular theme given by Eru. Sure enough, Eru makes the 'World and All That
Is'.

So when I get a new clean system there is nothing yet. And so I call upon the
wisdom and power of =Eru.sh= - the one who creates Ainur and the 'World and All
That Is'.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d12frosted/environment/master/eru.sh | bash
#+END_SRC

I just have to wait patiently, while everything is being downloaded and
installed, while all configuration cogs are being placed on the right spot.

</p>
#+END_HTML

The good thing about =Eru.sh= is that after the 'World and All That Is' creation
you can still call upon his help and you can even ask him to help with specific
theme or themes only.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ ./eru.sh                       # to help with all themes
  $ ./eru.sh repositories          # to help with repositories
  $ ./eru.sh repositories packages # to help with repositories and packages
#+END_SRC

=Eru.sh= reveals all available themes. For example,

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  => Guardian Theme :: Checking operating system
  => Supporting Theme :: Defining helpers
  => Supporting Theme :: Defining variables
  => Guardian Theme :: Ensure all directories exists
  -> SSH Theme :: Checking SSH keys
  -> Repositories Theme :: Sync environment repository
  -> Repositories Theme :: Sync repositories from Repofile
  -> Linking Theme :: Link all files as defined in Linkfile
#+END_SRC

Every theme that begins with ~=>~ is a mandatory theme - the one you can't skip.
Every theme prefixed with ~->~ is an optional one. If you don't specify any
themes, all optional themes are sung. If you do specify at least one theme -
only specified are sang.

You can read a little bit more about Eru in a [[https://d12frosted.io/posts/2018-11-04-revisiting-eru.html][Revisiting Eru]] blog post.

* Can I use your files?
Sure you can. But should you? :D

OK, jokes aside. It would be a pleasure to me knowing that someone finds
something useful in my configurations. I am trying to keep things as clear as
possible, but these are *personal* configurations, so I rarely think about any
compatibility with previous configurations or other platforms. In any case, if
you have questions or any problems with my configurations - just ping me. I'll
try to help you as much as I can. Any suggestions or pull requests are warmly
welcome!
