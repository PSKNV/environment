#+TITLE: Bootstrap domain

As you might know, Eru is the supreme deity of Arda. The first things that Eru
created where the Ainur. He then bade the Ainur to sing to him. Each Ainu had a
particular theme given by Eru. Sure enough, Eru makes the 'World and All That
Is'.

So when I get a new clean system there is nothing yet. And so I call upon the
wisdom and power of =Eru.sh= - the one who creates Ainur and the 'World and All
That Is'.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d12frosted/environment/master/bootstrap/eru.sh | bash
#+END_SRC

I just have to wait patiently, while everything is being downloaded and
installed, while all configuration cogs are being placed on the right spot.

#+BEGIN_HTML
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/eru-example-1.png" />
</p>
#+END_HTML

The good thing about =Eru.sh= is that after the 'World and All That Is' creation
you can still call upon his help and you can even ask him to help with specific
theme or themes only.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ ./bootstrap/eru.sh                   # to help with all themes
  $ ./bootstrap/eru.sh repositories      # to help with repositories
  $ ./bootstrap/eru.sh repositories packages # to help with repositories and packages
#+END_SRC

=Eru.sh= reveals all available themes. For example,

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  => Guardian Theme :: Checking operating system
  => Supporting Theme :: Defining helpers
  => Supporting Theme :: Defining variables
  => Guardian Theme :: Ensure all directories exists
  -> SSH Theme :: Checking SSH keys
  -> Repositories Theme :: Sync environment repository
  -> Repositories Theme :: Sync repositories from Repofile
  -> Linking Theme :: Link all files as defined in Linkfile
#+END_SRC

Every theme that begins with ~=>~ is a mandatory theme - the one you can't skip.
Every theme prefixed with ~->~ is an optional one. If you don't specify any
themes, all optional themes are sung. If you do specify at least one theme -
only specified are sang.

#+BEGIN_HTML
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/eru-example-2.png" />
</p>
#+END_HTML
