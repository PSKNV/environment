=git-notify= is utility script that notifies you when inspected repository has
new commits. This script is actually a modified version of [[https://gist.github.com/joehillen/8a123178145a1b38f0f8][git-notify.sh]] to make
it working on OS X via [[https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier][terminal-notifier]].

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ git-notify dir [remote branch]
#+END_SRC

The only mandatory argument is =dir= - path to local repository. You may also
specify =remote= and =branch= which are =origin= and =master= by default
respectively.
