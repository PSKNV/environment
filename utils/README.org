Some random utilities I use time to time. They don't belong to separate
repositories, so I store them here.

* Available utilities

1. =dump= - dumping files or directories by either copying or moving them with
   appended timestamp.
2. =git-notify= - tracking updates to repository.
3. =ipa-install= - installing =ipa= files to iOS devices (OS X only).
4. =sync_spacemacs= - update (and setup if necessary) Spacemacs installation.
5. =stack-install= - install stack package from git URL. Useful for binary
   packages only (obviously?).
