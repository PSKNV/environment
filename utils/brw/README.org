=Brw= is an utility for installing packages on OS X using =brew=. On other
operating systems it does nothing, so it's safe to use it in your environment
bootstrap scripts.

When =brw= is called it makes sure that =brew= is installed. After that it tries
to install specified package using =brew install= or =brew cask install=.

* Install

Make it available in your =PATH= or just use it from this directory.

* Usage

Just pass a list of packages you want to install.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ brw pkg1 pkg2 ...
#+END_SRC
