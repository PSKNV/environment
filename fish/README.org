Personal fish configuration. I am trying to make it fly!

* Dependencies

- =fish=
- =terminal-notifier= of version =1.6.2= or higher (OS X only)

As usual, these dependencies will be automatically bootstrapped during
environment installation. But in any case, you should check [[https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/#building][official
instructions]] on setting fish as your default shell.

* Custom lambda-prompt

Strong points of my custom [[file:functions/fish_prompt.fish][fish_prompt]] are:

1. it print non-zero status code of previous command
2. uses =__terlar_git_prompt= for being informative about git repositories and
   =__fish_hg_prompt= for mercurial repositories
3. prints duration of last executed command if it exceeds =8000= ms and notifies
   about completion using =terminal-notifier= (checkout =__d12_prompt_duration=
   function for more information)
4. minimalistic

* Batteries

There are some useful functions that come with my configs.

1. =__package_install PKG= - install =PKG= using =brew= if it's not yet
   installed (OS X only and /deprecated/ in favour of =brw=).
2. =dnvm= - wrapper for [[https://github.com/aspnet/dnvm][dnvm]].
3. =hglog= - pretty =log= for mercurial repository.
4. =convert_to_gif= - convert video file to gif. Video file must be supported by
   =ffmpeg=. Supports scaling. Dependencies will be installed on OS X
   automatically.
5. =convert_texture= - convert input texture to specified format using
   =TexturePacker=. For more information, checkout =$ TexturePacker --help=.
