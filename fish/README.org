[[https://d12frosted.io/posts/2015-02-07-make-the-fish-fly.html][Make the Fish fly]]. If it doesn't fly, it's not a [[https://fishshell.com][fish]].

* Dependencies

It's impossible to maintain the list of dependencies in documentation. =eru= is
your friend.

* Custom lambda-prompt

Strong points of my custom [[file:functions/fish_prompt.fish][fish_prompt]] are:

1. it print non-zero status code of previous command
2. uses =__terlar_git_prompt= for being informative about git repositories and
   =__fish_hg_prompt= for mercurial repositories
3. prints duration of last executed command if it exceeds =8000= ms and notifies
   about completion using =terminal-notifier= (checkout =__d12_prompt_duration=
   function for more information)
4. minimalistic

* Batteries

Uses [[https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher][fisher]] to install packages.

There are some useful functions that come with my configs.

1. =dnvm= - wrapper for [[https://github.com/aspnet/dnvm][dnvm]].
2. =hglog= - pretty =log= for mercurial repository.
3. =convert_texture= - convert input texture to specified format using
   =TexturePacker=. For more information, checkout =$ TexturePacker --help=.
